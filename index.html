            <h3>Project Indigo</h3>
            <p> Created this recognition system by incorporating Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which works great in image recognition. 
              Selected a database having almost 50,000 images of traffic sign from Kaggle website. 
              After training and testing the model, achieved 96% of accuracy which explains the efficiency of model to correctly recognize traffic signs.

            <h3>Language Detection using Machine Learning</h3>
            <p> Generated a language detection system using Multinomial Naïve Bayes (MNB) approach to automatically identify the language of a given text. 
              Used a dataset from Kaggle having 17-18 distinct languages and at least 1000 lines for each language. Applied various algorithms for training and testing and, proved that MNB approach works best with highest 95% of accuracy compared to other models
            This project was developed as a part of course submission in University of Guelph.
